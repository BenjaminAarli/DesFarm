## This script is for the naming convention used for the game.
## I've noticed that I, by not having a naming convention make work...
## ... a lot more unorganized than hoped for. 

## As such, I have started this guide to avoid evolving this issue. 

# Prefixes
# obj_"Name" is for objects
# scn_"Name" is for generic scenes. 
# map_"Name" is for level scenes.
