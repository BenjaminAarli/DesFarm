Hi! This is a game project made and maintained by Benjamin Aarli. 

It's a Godot Engine Game, so if you want to see the development stuff. 

1 - Download the Godot Game Engine at https://godotengine.org/
1.1 - Download this game. You probably already have if you are reading this. 
2 - Open up Godot and find the import button. 
2.1 - from inside the import window or whatever it is, find this game folder and find the "project.godot" file and import it! 
Now you should have all the files and stuff. It might not work, I included a couple of plugin libaries (Qodot) and it might effect a thing or two. 

WANT TO PLAY!! 
Find the "export" folder and find the game there. As you might expect, win is for WINDOWS. lin is for LINUX and mac is for MAC. 

if you are comfused about which version of windows you should use. 32bit or 64bit, try them both. Start with 32. 

Thank you for reading and I hope you like what little I have to show for now! 
Lots of love! <3 ~Benny
